## Ontology/Taxonomy
+ [SNOMED CT](https://www.snomed.org/), with a [online browser](http://browser.ihtsdotools.org/)  for clinical terms. 
  + the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world 
  + a resource with comprehensive, scientifically validated clinical content
  + Enables consistent, processable representation of clinical content in electronic health records
  + mapped to other international standards
  + already used in more than fifty countries
+ [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/)
  + The UMLS, or Unified Medical Language System, is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems.
  + The UMLS has three tools, which we call the Knowledge Sources. Metathesaurus: Terms and codes from many vocabularies, including CPT速, ICD-10-CM, LOINC速, MeSH速, RxNorm, and SNOMED CT速. Semantic Network: Broad categories (semantic types) and their relationships (semantic relations). SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools: Natural language processing tools
+ [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). Not limited to medical terms, see [types](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html).
  + A hierarchically-organized terminology for indexing and cataloging of biomedical information such as MEDLINE/PUBmed and other NLM databases. We also distribute pharmaceutical information through our RxNorm database, and manage the curation of the UMLS and SnoMed database.
+ [ICD11](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en) 
  + ICD-11 is much easier to use than ICD-10. Its ontological infrastructure allows for an improved user guidance compared to ICD-10.
  + The systematic reliance on the use of code combinations and extension codes makes ICD finally clinically relevant. With the combinations any condition can be coded to the desired level of detail.
  + ICD-11 is truly multilingual. ICD-10 exists in 43 Languages in electronic versions and ICD-11 has already 15 translations in progress. The tooling produces all files and formats from the core translation tooling on the maintenance platform . For authorization of translations, requests have to be made to WHO.
  + ICD-11 is digital health (formerly e-health) ready due to the use of uniform resource identifiers and its ontological underpinning. The system allows connection of any software through a standard API. The same package is also prepared for use offline.
  + In ICD-11, each disease entity has a description that give key descriptions and guidance on what the meaning of the entity/category is in human-readable terms, to guide users. This is an advancement over ICD-10, which had only title headings. The Definitions have a standard structure according to a template with standard definition templates and further features exemplified in a "Content Model". The Content Model is a structured framework that captures the knowledge that underpins the definition of an ICD entity. The Content Model therefore allows computerization (with links to ontologies and SNOMED CT). Each ICD entity can be seen from different dimensions or "parameters". For example, there are currently 13 defined main parameters in the Content Model (see below) to describe a category in ICD.
